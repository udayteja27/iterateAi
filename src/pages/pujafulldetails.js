            The Shani Shingnapur Temple in Maharashtra is considered the world's
            biggest Shani temple...
          </p>
          <p>
            The Shani Shingnapur Temple in Maharashtra is considered the world's
            biggest Shani temple. This temple of Lord Shani is known as the
            'Jagrut Devasthan', meaning Shani Dev himself resides here in the
            form of a stone idol. According to religious beliefs, performing
            Shani Puja and offering Til Tel at this ancient temple can provide
            relief from the effects of Shani Saade Saati. Shani Saade Saati is
            often considered unfavourable, with its impact divided into three
            phases of two and a half years each. During the initial phase of
            Saade Saati, Shani affects the mind of an individual which may cause
            financial and emotional challenges. The second phase of Saade Saati
            is considered the most challenging which can bring physical
            troubles. Its consequences can also affect an individual's family
            and professional life. In the final phase of Shani Saade Saati, a
            person may face various struggles, affecting them physically,
            mentally, and financially. Various types of worship are performed to
            reduce the malefic effects of Lord Shani, among which Shani Saade
            Saati Peeda Shanti Mahapuja and Til Tel Abhishek are extremely
            effective. Just as each deity has a special day, Saturday is
            dedicated to Lord Shani, and on this day, performing the Shani Saade
            Saati Peeda Shanti Mahapuja and Til Tel Abhishek are considered
            highly fruitful. Therefore, participate in this puja through Sri
            Mandir and attain the special grace of Lord Shani.
